Module Lab: Real-Time Customer Heartbeat Monitoring System
Completion requirements
Real-Time Customer Heartbeat Monitoring System
Project Overview
This project aims to simulate and process real-time heart rate data for customers using a data pipeline. You'll learn how to generate synthetic data, stream it using Apache Kafka, and store it in a PostgreSQL database. This hands-on project introduces you to important concepts like data simulation, message queuing, real-time processing, and database integration—core components of modern data engineering systems.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, students will be able to:

Simulate real-time sensor data to mimic heart rate monitors.

Use Kafka for real-time data streaming, setting up producers and consumers.

Process incoming data with basic validation and store it in a structured relational database.

Design and implement a PostgreSQL database schema suitable for time-series data.

Build and test a simple data pipeline, understanding each component's role.

Optionally visualize data using a basic dashboard.

Core Components
1. Synthetic Data Generator

Write a Python script that randomly generates heart beat data for multiple fake customers.

Data fields: customer_id, timestamp, and heart_rate.

2. Kafka Producer

Sends the generated data to a Kafka topic.

Configure it to send messages continuously, simulating a real-time feed.

3. Kafka Consumer

Listens to the Kafka topic, reads the messages, and optionally filters or checks for anomalies (e.g., heart rate too high/low).

Writes valid data into a PostgreSQL table.

4. PostgreSQL Database

Create a simple schema to store heart beat records with indexing on timestamps for efficient querying.

Use SQL for inserting and querying historical data.

Tasks
1. Data Simulation & Ingestion

Develop and run a Python script that continuously creates random but realistic heart beat readings.

Connect this script to a Kafka producer.

2. Real-Time Data Processing

Set up Kafka and a consumer app (in Python) that reads messages from the topic.

Process or clean data before sending it to the database.

3. Data Storage

Design a table in PostgreSQL to hold the customer heart beat data.

Write the logic to insert the processed data into the table.

4. System Setup and Testing

Use docker-compose (optional) to run Kafka, Zookeeper, and PostgreSQL locally.

Write test scripts to simulate different types of heart rate data and check if the full pipeline works.

5. Documentation & Reporting

Document your system architecture with diagrams (e.g., draw.io or hand sketches).

Write clear setup instructions for running the system.

Include screenshots of terminal outputs and database tables showing successful ingestion.

6. Optional Extensions

Build a basic dashboard with tools like:

Grafana (with PostgreSQL as a data source)

Dash or Streamlit (Python-based)

Deliverables
Python scripts (data generator, Kafka producer/consumer)

SQL file to create database schema

Docker Compose file (optional but recommended)

ReadMe file with setup guide and documentation

Data flow diagram (PDF or image)

Sample data outputs or screenshots

(Optional) Dashboard interface or screenshots
